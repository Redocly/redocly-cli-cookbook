# Decorator to sort tags in an API description

## What this does and why

Redocly CLI has the [`tags-alphabetical`](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/tags-alphabetical/) rule to error if the `tags` section isn't in alphabetical order by `name`.

This decorator provides functionality to _put_ the tags in order by name, in order to make any API description compatible with that rule.

## Code

Here's the main plugin entrypoint, it's in `tag-sorting.js`:

```javascript

const SortTagsAlphabetically = require('./decorator-alpha');

module.exports = function tagSortingPlugin() {
  return {
    id: 'tag-sorting',
    decorators: {
      oas3: {
        'alphabetical': SortTagsAlphabetically,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The code here sets the plugin name to `tag-sorting` and adds a decorator for OpenAPI 3 called `alphabetical`.

The functionality for the alphabetical sorting is in `decorator-alpha.js`:

```javascript

module.exports = SortTagsAlphabetically;

function SortTagsAlphabetically() {
  console.log("re-ordering tags: alphabetical");
  return {
    TagList: {
      leave(target) {
        target.sort((a,b) => {
          if (a.name < b.name) {
            return -1;
          }
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It operates on the `TagList` element, since it needs to shuffle the child entries inside it. A simple comparison of the name field is used to sort the items.

## Examples

Add the plugin to `redocly.yaml` and enable the decorator:

```yaml
plugins:
  - './tag-sorting.js'

decorators:
  tag-sorting/alphabetical: on
```

Now with an OpenAPI description that has more than one tag listed at the top level, the decorator will re-order the entries.

**Before**:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: user
    description: Users
  - name: site
    description: Restaurant sites
```

**After**:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: site
    description: Restaurant sites
  - name: user
    description: Users
```
