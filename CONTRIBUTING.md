# Contributing to Redocly CLI Cookbook

Thanks for sharing your Redocly CLI wisdom with everyone! In order to add your ideas in a way that everyone can understand, please follow these steps to contribute to the project.

## Add your work in a new directory

Every item added to this repository belongs in its own directory. Identify which top-level directory is most appropriate, and then create a directory inside it, named for the thing you are adding.

For example, to add a configurable rule that makes sure every endpoint is tagged "cupcake" (an imaginary example):

```text
.
├── configurable-rules
│   └── endpoints-are-tagged-cupcake
```

Give the directory a meaningful name; people may browse the collection this way.

## Add your files

Put the file or files that you want to share into your new directory. Try to name them in a way that can be re-used by other people and clearly understood.

## Create the README

Copy the `readme-template.md` from the root of the project into your new directory, and name it `README.md`. Edit and complete this file - this is required for your contribution to be added to our collection. Your directory structure should look like this:

```text
.
├── configurable-rules
│   └── endpoints-are-tagged-cupcake
│       └── README.md
```

Give users a clear idea of what problem your addition solves and any other related context that can help them to be successful too.

## List your addition on the main page

We keep a catalog of what's included in the main `README.md` file. Add your new entry at the end of the list in the relevant section.

## Open a pull request

Commit your changes to a new branch in your own repository fork, and then open a pull request to our repo. Someone from Redocly will review and offer suggestions or let you know if anything needs changing. Once it's ready, we'll merge and others can benefit from your wisdom!
