# `Deprecated` services SHOULD define a standard set of headers to communicate `Deprecation` and `Sunset` information. There should also exist a `Link` header to inform the consumer where the service location has been moved to, if any

Authors:

## What this does and why

There are three parts to a deprecation strategy. Defining _when_ (`deprecation`) the service will be deprecated, the `sunset` date of the service for it to be completely turned off, and a `link` to where a replacement service may exist. We use a number of RFC standards to define these header fields. 

- [RFC7231][4]
- [RFC8288][1]
- [RFC8594][3]
- [RFC9651][5]
- [RFC9745][2]

### 2XX responses

_while the service remains active_

* We must define the requirement for the `headers` map to exist in a `2XX` response
* We define the required headers: `deprecation`, `sunset`, `link`

### 410 Gone response

_the service is no longer available_

* A deprecated service must define a `410` response
* We must define the requirement for the `headers` map to exist
* After a service has been deprecated, the `deprecation` header must not be provided.
* A `sunset` header to indicate when the service was removed and a `link` header to indicate where a new service can be found
