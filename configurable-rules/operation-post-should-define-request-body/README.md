# `POST` SHOULD define `requestBody` schema

## What this does and why

Following the HTTP standard and RESTful API principles, a `POST` request SHOULD include a `requestBody` indicating the contents of the request to the server. In some cases, when using a command pattern (`/actions/{action-id}`), you may allow a `requestBody` to be omitted; this rule provides for the option to ignore a particular URI pattern. The other constraint on this rule is the `deprecated` property should not be defined to avoid linting deprecated endpoints, unnecessarily.

## Code

Add this to the `rules` section of your `redocly.yaml`:

```yaml
rules:
  rule/post-should-define-requestBody:
    severity: error
    message: '"POST" SHOULD define a "requestBody" schema unless using an "actions" pattern'
    subject:
      type: Operation
    where:
      - subject:
          type: PathItem
          # Here you can define your own URI pattern to ignore if providing a requestBody is not required.
          # The negation happens in this portion of the regex `(?<!/actions)`.
          # The regex takes the entire URI pattern string and then uses a "negative lookbehind" from the end of the string to find the pattern to be negated.
          matchParentKeys: /^([\w-\{\}/.](?<!/actions))*$/
        assertions:
          defined: true
      - subject:
          type: Operation
          filterInParentKeys:
            - post
        assertions:
          disallowed:
            - deprecated
    assertions:
      required:
        - requestBody
```

This rule will error if any URI pattern, other than the ignored pattern, includes a `POST` request without the `requestBody` schema definition.
Note the `where` section is used to filter the rule to only apply to `POST`, non-`deprecated`, and optionally ignored URI patterns.

## Examples

Here's a sample of an OpenAPI description:

Only one error is expected from this example because the second URI includes the `/actions` pattern ignored by the rule.

```yaml
