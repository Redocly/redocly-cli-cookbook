# API Health

## What this does and why

This set of configurable rules checks that an API conforms to expected health check standards.
Three rules are included and they check the following:
- `/health` endpoint is defined
- The `200` response uses the `application/health+json` media type
- The response contains the mandatory `status` property

Source: [Proposed Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-06).

## Code

The first rule checks that a health path is defined.
```yaml
  rule/health-endpoint:
    subject:
      type: Paths
    assertions:
      required:
        - '/health'
    message: API must have a health endpoint.
```

The second rule checks that the response uses the `application/health+json` media type.

It uses a `where` clause to target the check to the successful health response.

```yaml
  rule/health-media-type:
    subject:
      type: MediaTypesMap
    assertions:
      const: application/health+json
    where:
      - subject:
          type: PathItem
          matchParentKeys: '/health'
        assertions:
          defined: true
      - subject:
          type: Response
          matchParentKeys: '200'
        assertions:
          defined: true
    message: API Health response has media type `application/health+json`
    severity: error
```

The final rule checks that the response has the required `status` property.

It uses a `where` clause to target the check to the successful health response.

```yaml
  rule/health-schema-status:
    where:
      - subject:
          type: PathItem
          matchParentKeys: '/health'
        assertions:
          defined: true
      - subject:
          type: Response
          matchParentKeys: '200'
        assertions:
          defined: true
    subject:
      type: SchemaProperties
    assertions:
      required:
        - status
    message: API Health response must have a required property `status`
    severity: error
```


## Examples

The following OpenAPI passes the configurable rules.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Sample health check
  version: demo
paths:
  /health:
    get:
      summary: Health check
      description: Check the health of our API.
      operationId: Health
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Pass or warn
          content:
            application/health+json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                    description: The status of the API.
                    enum:
                      - pass
                      - warn
        '400':
          description: Fail
          content:
            application/health+json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                    description: The status of the API.
                    enum:
                      - fail
```

Not having the `/health` path defined or not have the `status` property or `application/health+json` response media type defined result in problems.
