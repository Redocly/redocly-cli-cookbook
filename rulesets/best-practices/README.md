# Best practices ruleset

Authors:
- `@CidTori`
 

## What this does and why

This ruleset combines unopinionated, "best practices" rules with the spec-compliant ruleset.

They are useful without adding too much noise in most cases, and prevent oversights.

## Code

You can use it in your `redocly.yaml` wih [`extends`](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/extends/), or you can copy its content directly:

```yaml
extends:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redocly/redocly-cli-cookbook/main/rulesets/spec-compliant/redocly.yaml 

rules:
  no-server-example.com: warn
  no-server-trailing-slash: warn
  no-ambiguous-paths: warn
  no-path-trailing-slash: warn
  operation-operationId: warn
  no-enum-type-mismatch: warn
  no-unused-components: warn
```

## References

As explained in [that issue](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli/issues/1331), here is why each rule is included:

- `no-server-example.com`: most likely a copy-paste error from some example in a documentation
- `no-server-trailing-slash`: prevents double slash between the server and the endpoint path, no downside
- `no-ambiguous-paths`: ambiguous paths may be hard to see without a linter, and preventing them is a good practice
- `no-path-trailing-slash`: avoid confusion, no downside
- `operation-operationId`: as the rule itself says: "This rule is unopinionated."
- `no-enum-type-mismatch`: as the rule itself says: "Lack of compliance is most likely the result of a typo."
- `no-unused-components`: unused components are hard to spot without a linter, and most of the time you just want to remove them

Please, feel free to comment in the [corresponding issue](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli/issues/1331) if you have elements against some of these rules.
