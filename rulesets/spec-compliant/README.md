# spec-compliant ruleset

## What this does and why

This ruleset uses the current built-in rules to stick closely to the spec.

It's an unopinionated good default.

REQUIRED rules (in the spec) are set to `error`, RECOMMENDED rules to `warn`.

## Code

You can use it in your `redocly.yaml` wih [`extends`](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/extends/), or you can copy its content directly:

```yaml
rules:
  spec: error
  spec-strict-refs: error
  no-undefined-server-variable: error
  path-not-include-query: error
  path-declaration-must-exist: error
  no-identical-paths: error
  path-parameters-defined: error
  operation-operationId-url-safe: warn
  operation-operationId-unique: error
  operation-parameters-unique: error
  operation-2xx-response: warn
  no-invalid-parameter-examples: warn
  no-invalid-media-type-examples: warn
  no-invalid-schema-examples: warn
  no-example-value-and-externalValue: error
  no-unresolved-refs: error
  spec-components-invalid-map-name: error
```
