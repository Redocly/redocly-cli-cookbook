# Redocly CLI Cookbook

A community collection of rulesets, configuration, custom plugins and other additions for [Redocly CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-cli). We know our users have some great tips, examples, and code to share, and this is the place to do just that. We would love to have your [contributions](#contributing) here too!

> [!IMPORTANT]
Redocly are the repository maintainers, but we can't thoroughly test everything here. Please browse, share, and use what you find at your own risk.

If you're new to Redocly CLI, start with the [documentation](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/) to get up and running, then come back here to pick out any elements you would like to re-use yourself. To keep up with new developments, either subscribe to the project repository, or [sign up for the Redocly product newsletter](https://redocly.com/product-updates/).

## Categories

### Rulesets

Combine existing [built-in rules](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/built-in-rules/) in ways that serve a specific purpose, and make a [resuable ruleset](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/guides/configure-rules/#create-a-reusable-ruleset).

### Configurable rules

There are some fantastic examples of [configurable rules](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/configurable-rules/) in the wild, we hope the list here inspires you to share more of your own!

### Custom plugins

The [custom plugin](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/custom-plugins/) is the ultimate in extensibility, but it's an advanced feature. Try these plugins for inspiration and to get you started. Rather than including the whole plugin, there are also sections for individual rules and decorators further down.

#### Decorators (for custom plugins)

#### Rules (for custom plugins)

### Miscellaneous (including tips and tricks)

Share anything that didn't fit the existing categories here.
